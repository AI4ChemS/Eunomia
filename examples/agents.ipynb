      "- MOF-12: Unstable (partial dissolution, significant crystallite fragmentation and pitting)\n",
      "- MOF-13: Unstable (partial dissolution, significant crystallite fragmentation and pitting, but more stable than MOF-12)\n",
      "- MOF-14: Stable (no loss of crystallinity, minimal pitting on crystal surface, water does not affect porosity)\u001b[0m\n",
