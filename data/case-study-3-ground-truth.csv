Even solvent exchanges by using different solvents like MeOH, EtOH, Me2CO or CH2Cl2, followed by mild activation, lead to complete breakdown of the framework. This behaviour leads us to postulate that Zn2+ ions with d10 electron configuration provide no ligand-field stabilization energy and presumably the vulnerability of framework 1 originates from the removal of the axial aqua ligand. The unstable nature of 1 upon de-solvation prevents us from obtaining a porous framework for gas-storage applications.
