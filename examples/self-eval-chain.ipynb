These small modi-\\ue103cations to the bio-MOF-11 structure would allow us to carefullymodulate both the cavity size and the pore hydrophobicity. To\\nrealize this design strategy, we prepared the cobalt mono-\\ncarboxylate salts (cobalt propionate, cobalt butyrate, and cobaltvalerate) and then reacted these salts with adenine under sol-vothermal conditions. Each reaction yielded crystalline product.Collection and subsequent re \\ue103nement of single crystal X-ray\\ndiﬀraction data for each product MOF, bio-MOF-12 (Co\\n2(ad) 2-\\n(C2H5CO2)2),bio-MOF-13 (Co 2(ad) 2(C3H7CO2)2), and bio-MOF-\\n14(Co 2(ad) 2(C4H9CO2)2) (Fig. 2), con \\ue103rmed that they were iso-\\nstructural to bio-MOF-11 .23,43,44The complete compositions of\\nthe solvated samples were determined viaelemental analysis.\\nBio-MOFs-12 ,13, and 14each crystallize in the tetragonal space\\ngroup ( I41/a), and the unit cells are similar to each other and to\\nbio-MOF-11 (Table 1).
